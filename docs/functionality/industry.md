# Industrial Energy Demand

## Overview

Industry demand is updated from the standard PyPSA-Eur values using data
from the [TransHyDe](https://www.transhyde.eu) project. Two modifications
are made relative to base PyPSA-Eur:

1. **Carrier ratios** for high-temperature processes are remapped to hydrogen
   to better reflect intra-country spatial distribution
2. **Absolute country totals** are scaled to match TransHyDe demand values

## Snakemake Rules

| Rule | Script | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `build_industry_sector_ratios` | `scripts/build_industry_sector_ratios.py` | Set carrier ratios per industry sector |
| `build_industrial_energy_demand_per_node` | `scripts/build_industrial_energy_demand_per_node.py` | Scale absolute demands to TransHyDe totals |

---

## Demand Scenarios

Three demand scenarios are defined in `build_industry_sector_ratios.py`:

| `demand_scenario` | Description |
|---|---|
| `original` | Reverts to base PyPSA-Eur v0.10.0 carrier ratios |
| `high-temperature` | Hydrogen replaces fossil fuels in furnaces and smelters — reflects TransHyDe Scenario 1.5 (Mid Demand) |
| `high-temperature+steam` | As above, plus hydrogen replaces steam processing — reflects TransHyDe Scenario 2 (High Demand) |

The carrier ratio scenario is selected via `transhyde_processes` in the config:

```yaml title="config/config.agora.yaml"
industry:
  transhyde_data: true
  transhyde_processes: high_temp_only  # use "high-temperature" ratios
  transhyde_scenario: 1.5             # selects input CSV: TH_S1.5_demand.csv
```

`transhyde_scenario` (`1.5` or `2`) and `transhyde_processes` are **independent**:
`transhyde_scenario` selects which TransHyDE CSV is loaded for absolute demand scaling;
`transhyde_processes` controls carrier ratios. They can be combined freely — for example,
the `CE_TranshydeS2` scenario uses `transhyde_scenario: 2` with the default
`transhyde_processes: high_temp_only`.

## Hydrogen Demand Distribution

When `transhyde_data: true`, carrier ratios for high-temperature industrial
processes (furnaces, smelters) are remapped to hydrogen. This only affects
**spatial distribution** within a country — the absolute country totals are
overwritten in the next step. From the script docstring:

> When `transhyde_data` is True, processes (mostly heat) are mapped from
> originally electricity/biomass/gas to hydrogen. The mapping is not precise;
> the aim is to get a more realistic distribution of the demand within a country.

## Scaling to TransHyDe Totals

`build_industrial_energy_demand_per_node` reads TransHyDe CSV data and scales
PyPSA-Eur's country-level totals to match. The scaling preserves the
intra-country distribution from `build_industry_sector_ratios`:

```python title="scripts/build_industrial_energy_demand_per_node.py"
# Calculate per-carrier scaling factor: TransHyDe total / PyPSA total
factor = (demand_th_p / nodal_df_grp_m).fillna(1.0)

# Apply factor to all nodes, preserving intra-country distribution
nodal_df *= factor

# Where PyPSA has zero demand but TransHyDe has non-zero,
# distribute TransHyDe total using node weights
```

The TransHyDe data files are in `data/transhyde/`.

## Ammonia and Methanol Imports

The model can reduce industrial energy demand when ammonia or methanol are
imported rather than produced domestically. Both are disabled by default:

```yaml title="config/config.agora.yaml"
sector:
  ammonia: false
  ammonia_import: false
  ammonia_import_share: 50   # % of demand met by imports, if enabled
  methanol_import: false
  methanol_import_share: 50  # % of demand met by imports, if enabled
```

---

## How to Change the TransHyDe Scenario

Set `transhyde_processes` to control carrier ratios, and `transhyde_scenario` to
select the input CSV for absolute scaling:

```yaml
industry:
  transhyde_processes: high_temp_only  # default; or: with_steam
  transhyde_scenario: 1.5              # default (Mid Demand); or: 2 (High Demand)
```
